BUGS FOUND AND FIXED BY UNIT TEST (should be 4-5):

Bug 0:
  Class: Bidder.java
	Method: attribute initialization
	Line: 12
	Cause: incorrect initialization of bidderReady that assumed the creation of the bidder succeeded
	Fix:  default bidderReady value to false

Bug 1:
  Class: Auction.java
	Method: openAuction
	Line: 54-61
	Cause: boolean variable 'opened' always initialized to false.
	Fix: changed opened to 'true' when state == NewAuction (ie, when a new auction is opened, the variable should return true)

Bug 2:
  Class: Auction.java
	Method: closeAuction
	Line: 65-72
	Cause: boolean variable 'closed' always initialized to false.
	Fix: changed closed to 'true' when state == openAuction (ie, when the auction finishes, change state from openAuction to closedAuction and change closed to true.)

Bug 3:
  Class: Auction.java
	Method: Auction (constructor)
	Line: 28
	Cause: lastLotNumber was not assigned to be greater than 0, therefore was allowing negative numbers
	Fix: added a statement to cause lastLotNumber to be greater than 0 (lastLotNumber > 0)

Bug 4:
  Class: Lot
	Method: placeBid
	Line: 66-74
	Cause: No statement used to validate bidderId
	Fix: added an for loop to make sure that the given bidderId was valid (inside the list of bidders for the auction)

Bug 5:
  Class: Bidder
	Method: feesOwed
	Line: 37
	Cause: Fee's were not being correctly added together (were just being overwritten instead of adding to previous)
	Fix: Added a += instead of just an = in order to add to existing instead of overwriting

Bug 6:
  Class: Lot
	Method: placeBid
	Line: 99
	Cause: No way to check if minimum increment is being met
	Fix: Implemented an if statement to check if the minimum increment is being met per bid


Bug 7:
    Class: Auction
	Method: getStatus
	Line: 96
	Cause: for loop was not looping to end of auction properly (missing out on last lot in the auction)
	Fix: added the = in the for loop (lot <= lotEnd)

Bug 8:
    Class: Lot
	Method: isClosed
	Line: 117-123
	Cause: was only returning the negative of isOpen instead of having an option to return
	negative if the auction was in neither open or closed state (ie newAuction state)
	Fix: added an if statement to check to see what state the auction was in and if not
	in closed state, return false.
